0,1877202,Jacques-Louis David,"The Athenian courts executed the Greek philosopher Socrates (469–399 B.C.) for the crime of impiety: his behavior toward the gods was judged to have been irreverent, and he had exerted a corrupting influence on his young male followers. Socrates declined to renounce his beliefs and died willingly, discoursing on the immortality of the soul before drinking from the cup of poisonous hemlock. In a prison of unrelieved severity, David depicted a frieze of carefully articulated figures in antique costume acting out in the language of gesture the last moments of the moral philosopher’s life. Because, shortly before the onset of the French revolution, the painting gave expression to the principle of resisting unjust authority, it is among David’s most important works. The canvas is also his most perfect statement of the Neoclassical style",The Death of Socrates

The eldest boy carries the weight of the family on his shoulders, and the little boat stands for the rigours of life at sea. Jozef Israëls first painted this subject in 1863. It became enormously popular and the artist subsequently repeated it often.",Children of the Sea

This is reinforced by the striking use of light and shade. The men appear to be emerging from a dark gateway into the light. The girl to the captain’s left is in full light. She symbolizes the Kloveniers. The claws of the chicken hanging from her belt refer to the name ‘clauweniers’. She clasps the Kloveniers’ ceremonial drinking horn.",Night Watch

12,109122,Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,"In this painting, Toulouse-Lautrec captures the exuberant energy and seedy underbelly of Paris night life. As if through an opening in the crowd, we glimpse the center of the Moulin Rouge. A dancer in mid-kick lifts her skirt above her knees, while a much more modestly dressed and apparently well-heeled woman with an upturned nose looks on, a hint of disapproval in her expression. Yet why is she in this space? Toulouse-Lautrec, a great observer of night life, was familiar with Degas's depictions of the ballet. Here, he is giving a nod to the older artist, but has shifted the scene from the more regimented structure of the practice room to the dance hall with its cast of characters. The composition is like a spinning top with the female dancer at its center. ([The Art Story](https://www.theartstory.org/artist-toulouse-lautrec-henri.htm))",At the Moulin Rouge: The Dance

""The Dance Lesson"" is the first of a series of roughly 40 pictures that Degas painted in this unusual, almost panoramic format.

A man faces his demise on a dismasted, rudderless fishing boat, sustained by only a few stalks of sugarcane and threatened by sharks and a distant waterspout. He is oblivious to the schooner on the left horizon, which Homer later added to the canvas as a sign of hopeful rescue.

Each painting provides a direct sense of how the artist viewed each scene, interpreted through his eyes, mind, and heart.

The Inferno tells the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the ""realm ... of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen"".

The architectural setting of the fresco seamlessly merges with the piece as a perfect example of trompe d'oeil. It is as if the wall itself is opening to reveal this spacious classical setting, its arches leading to the blue sky in the background. The building depicted is a Greek cross, and was influenced by the architect Bramante's designs.

The 'Temeraire' is shown travelling east, away from the sunset, even though Rotherhithe is west of Sheerness, but Turner's main concern was to evoke a sense of loss, rather than to give an exact recording of the event. The spectacularly colourful setting of the sun draws a parallel with the passing of the old warship. By contrast the new steam-powered tug is smaller and more prosaic. Turner was in his sixties when he painted 'The Fighting Temeraire'. It shows his mastery of painting techniques to suggest sea and sky.
